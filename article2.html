            <p><b>Section 1557 Affordable Health Care Act</b> <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
              <br/><br/>
                Section 1557 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex,age or disability in certain health programs and activities.
                <br/><br/>
                Section 1557 builds on long-standing and familiar Federal civil rights laws: Title VI of the Civil Rights
                Act of 1964 (Title VI), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX), Section 504 of the
                Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (Age Act). Most
                notably, Section 1557 is the first Federal civil rights law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in
                all health programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance.
                Section 1557 has been in effect since enactment of the ACA in 2010 and the HHS Office for Civil
                Rights (OCR) has been enforcing the provision since it was enacted.
                <br/><br/>
                Coverage of the Rule:
                The rule covers:
                − Any health program or activity, any part of which receives funding from HHS (such as hospitals
                that accept Medicare or doctors who accept Medicaid);
                − Any health program that HHS itself administers;
                − Health Insurance Marketplaces and issuers that participate in those Marketplaces.
                Protections under the rule
                Section 1557 builds on prior Federal civil rights laws to prohibit sex discrimination in health care. The
                final rule requires that women be treated equally with men in the health care they receive and also
                prohibits the denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual’s sex, including
                discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping. The final rule also requires
                covered health programs and activities to treat individuals consistent with their gender identity.
                For individuals with disabilities, the final rule requires covered entities to make all programs and
                activities provided through electronic and information technology accessible; to ensure the physical
                accessibility of newly constructed or altered facilities; and to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and
                services for individuals with disabilities. Covered entities are also prohibited from using marketing
                practices or benefit designs that discriminate on the basis of disability and other prohibited bases.
                Covered entities must take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to each individual with
                limited English proficiency eligible to be served or likely to be encountered in their health programs 
                and activities. In addition, covered entities are encouraged to develop and implement a language
                access plan.
                <br/><br/>
                The final rule on Section 1557 does not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not
                displace existing protections for religious freedom and conscience.
                <br/><br/>
                Procedural Requirements:
                The final rule implementing Section 1557 requires covered entities with 15 or more employees to have
                a grievance procedure and a compliance coordinator. The final rule includes an Appendix that
                provides a model grievance procedure for covered entities. Entities with fewer than 15 employees are
                not required to have a grievance procedure or compliance coordinator.
                The final rule requires that covered entities post notices of nondiscrimination and taglines that alert
                individuals with limited English proficiency to the availability of language assistance services. To
                reduce burden and costs, OCR has translated a sample notice and taglines for use by covered
                entities into 64 languages. For translated materials, visit www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/forindividuals/section-1557/translated-resources/index.html.
                The final rule requires each covered entity to post taglines in at least the top 15 non-English
                languages spoken in the State in which the entity is located or does business. Those requirements
                are modified for small sized significant communications such as postcards; for these, the final rule
                requires entities to post a nondiscrimination statement and taglines in at least the top two non-English
                languages spoken by individuals with limited English proficiency in the State.
                <br/><br/>
                Enforcement:
                The existing enforcement mechanisms under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504 and the Age Act apply for
                redress of violations of Section 1557. These mechanisms include: requiring covered entities to keep
                records and submit compliance reports to OCR, conducting compliance reviews and complaint
                investigations, and providing technical assistance and guidance.
                Where noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means,
                available enforcement mechanisms include suspension of, termination of, or refusal to grant or
                continue Federal financial assistance; referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation to
                bring proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States; and any other means authorized by law.
                The final rule also recognizes that an individual may bring a civil action to challenge a Section 1557
                violation.
                <br/><br/>
                Responses to Comments on the Proposed Rule Reflected in the Final Rule:
                − Sexual orientation discrimination: While the final rule does not resolve whether discrimination
                on the basis of an individual's sexual orientation status alone is a form of sex discrimination
                under Section 1557, the rule makes clear that OCR will evaluate complaints that allege sex
                discrimination related to an individual’s sexual orientation to determine if they involve the sorts
                of stereotyping that can be addressed under Section 1557. HHS supports prohibiting sexual
                orientation discrimination as a matter of policy and will continue to monitor legal developments
                on this issue.
                − No new religious exemption: The proposed rule sought comment on whether there should be
                an exemption for religious organizations in circumstances in which nondiscrimination
                obligations conflict with religious beliefs. As noted above, the final rule on Section 1557 does 
                not include a religious exemption; however, the final rule does not displace existing protections
                for religious freedom and conscience.
                − Benefit design in health coverage plans: OCR received comments that issuers would need
                time to come into compliance with the requirement prohibiting discrimination in benefit design.
                The final rule establishes that to the extent the provisions of the rule require changes to health
                insurance or group health plan benefit design, such provisions have an applicability date of the
                first day of the first plan year (in the individual market, policy year) beginning on or after
                January 1, 2017.
                − Complaints against Third-Party Administrators (TPAs): The proposed rule noted that where an
                entity acts as a TPA for a health plan, OCR would engage in a case-by-case analysis to
                determine coverage under Section 1557. The final rule states that OCR will investigate the
                TPA when the alleged discrimination is in the administration of the plan; where the alleged
                discrimination is in benefit design, OCR will process the complaint against the employer/plan
                sponsor and typically will refer the matter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
                (EEOC) if OCR lacks jurisdiction over the employer.
                − Standards for single sex programs: The proposed rule sought comment on the standard for
                evaluating single sex health programs. The final rule allows these programs only where a
                covered entity has an exceedingly persuasive justification.
                − Language access: Covered entities are encouraged to develop a language access plan.

            <p class="billBodyText">
                Half of 137,501 covered entities are expected to revise their policies to stop prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity. OCR considers this a benefit of the rule: organizations will have lower labor costs and lower litigation costs because they will no longer have to process grievances or defend against lawsuits brought by transgender people. 
                <br/><br/>
                The proposed rule would entirely eliminate the definitions section of the current rule. OCR would no longer define key terms like “on the basis of sex” and “covered entity.” Because many of these terms were defined broadly, eliminating these definitions would remove explicit references to protected classes or specific protections and benefits.

                Under Section 1303, health plans are not required to cover abortion services as part of the essential health benefits package and cannot discriminate against providers or facilities because of their unwillingness to provide, pay for, cover, or refer for abortions.
                <br/><br/>
                Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations cannot be compelled to provide, reimburse for, or cover counseling or referrals that they object to on moral or religious grounds.
