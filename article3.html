                <br/><br/>
                (Sec. 20404) Provides that, in the case of a prisoner convicted of an offense committed prior to November 1, 1987, a reference under the code to supervised release shall be deemed to be a reference to probation or parole.
                <br/><br/>
                (Sec. 20405) Amends the Federal criminal code to repeal the requirement that credit toward service of sentence for satisfactory behavior ("good time") be granted to a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year for a crime of violence. Allows a prisoner serving such a sentence, at the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons, to receive such credit if the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.
                <br/><br/>
                (Sec. 20406) Requires the Director of the National Institute of Corrections to establish a task force on prison construction standardization techniques and cost-cutting new building materials and technologies.

                Authorizes the Attorney General to assess the cost efficiency and utility of using modular, prefabricated, precast, and pre-engineered construction components and designs for housing nonviolent criminals.
                <br/><br/>
                (Sec. 20408) Amends the National Literacy Act of 1991 to authorize the Secretary of Education to convene and consult with a panel of experts in correctional education to: (1) develop measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the literacy programs funded; and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of such programs.

                (Sec. 20409) Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a Federal court from holding prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment except to the extent that an individual plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding causes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment of that inmate. Specifies that, in such cases, the relief shall extend no further than necessary to remove the conditions that are causing the cruel and unusual punishment of the plaintiff inmate.
                <br/><br/>
                Prohibits a Federal court from placing a ceiling on the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility as an equitable remedial measure for conditions that violate the Eighth Amendment unless crowding is inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners. Leaves intact Federal judicial power to issue other equitable relief where appropriate, including the requirement of improved medical or health care and the imposition of civil contempt fines or damages.
                <br/><br/>
                Requires that each Federal court order or consent decree seeking to remedy an Eighth Amendment violation be reopened at the behest of a defendant for recommended modification at a minimum of two-year intervals.

            <p class="billSubTopic">For black people</p>
            <p class="billBodyText">
                Known as a “direct descendant of lynching,” the death penalty has always targeted and terrorized black and Latinx communities. The death penalty is more likely to be recommended when the victim of the crime is white rather than black, despite the fact that black men are the most likely victims of homicide.
                <br/><br/>
                If this directive survives litigation, it is expected to worsen racial disparities in the application of the death penalty, as black people are far more likely than white people to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated for drug crimes—even though they use and sell drugs at similar rates.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="boxedbills">
            <p class="billSubTopic">For other racial minority groups</p>
            <p class="billBodyText">
                The crime bill implemented a rash of new three-strikes laws—laws that impose automatic life sentences for people convicted of certain felony offenses if they already have two convictions on their record.
                <br/><br/>
                Imposing life sentences simply because an individual has a criminal record disproportionately targets people of color, who are more likely to have a record in the first place because of unequal contact with police and the justice system. Harsh collateral consequences limit employment opportunities for returning people, especially people of color, and increase the likelihood of recidivism.
